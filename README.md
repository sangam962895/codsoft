## 📂 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Task 1 – Number Guessing Game 🎲
- A fun game where the computer selects a random number, and the user tries to guess it.  
- Features:  
  - Hints if the guess is too high or low  
  - Tracks attempts until the correct guess  

---

### 🔹 Task 2 – Student Grade Calculator 📊
- A program to calculate a student’s **average percentage** and assign grades.  
- Features:  
  - Input marks for multiple subjects  
  - Calculates average  
  - Assigns grades based on performance  

---

### 🔹 Task 3 – ATM Interface 🏦
- A **command-line ATM simulator** that mimics real-world banking.  
- Features:  
  - Balance check, deposit, and withdrawal  
  - Input validation & error handling  
  - Simulates ATM experience in simple form
